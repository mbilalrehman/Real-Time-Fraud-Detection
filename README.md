# Real-time Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. The primary challenge of this dataset is its **extreme class imbalance** (99.8% non-fraud vs. 0.2%), making traditional accuracy metrics useless.

## Project Goal
To build and compare several models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) using advanced techniques to handle imbalanced data, focusing on high-recall for the 'Fraud' class.

## Methodology
1.  **Data:** Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (`creditcard.csv`).
2.  **Preprocessing:** Scaled `Amount` and `Time` features using `StandardScaler`.
3.  **Imbalance Handling:** Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** *only* on the training data to prevent data leakage.
4.  **Modeling:**
    * Trained a **Logistic Regression** as a baseline.
    * Trained an **XGBoost Classifier** for superior performance.
5.  **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated using the **Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PRC)** and **F1-Score**, which are robust metrics for imbalanced data.

## Key Results
The XGBoost model significantly outperformed the baseline, achieving a higher F1-score and demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

*(Note: Results are generated in the Python script)*

| Model | F1-Score (Fraud Class) | Recall (Fraud Class) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Logistic Regression | *(Generated by script)* | *(Generated by script)* |
| **XGBoost** | *(Generated by script)* | *(Generated by script)* |

## How to Use (Simulating Real-Time)
The best model is saved as `fraud_detection_model.pkl`. It can be loaded to predict new transactions in real-time:

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # Zaroori

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('fraud_detection_model.pkl')

# New transaction data (example, 30 features)
# Zaroori: New transaction data ko bhi bilkul waisay hi scale karna hoga jaisay training data
# (Yeh ek sample hai, real transaction data yahan aaye ga)
new_transaction_raw = np.array([
    # V1, V2, ... V28, scaled_amount, scaled_time
    -1.35, -0.07, 2.53, ..., 1.25, -0.45, -0.99
]).reshape(1, -1) 

# Prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_transaction_raw)

if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("ALERT: This transaction is likely FRAUDULENT.")
else:
    print("Transaction is normal.")
